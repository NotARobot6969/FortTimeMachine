# FortTimeMachine
It's like a time machine, but for Fortnite. This code is currently a dumpster fire, we'll probably clean it up later.

# Usage
- Compile FortTimeMachine.
- Open up Fortnite, inject console unlocker.
- Open Athena_Terrain, then type "summon PlayerPawn_Athena_C" in console.
- Inject the compiled DLL.

Please note: Characters do not work, we've tried just about everything to get them working. If you can get it working, please let us know!
